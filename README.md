##Diabetic Prediction Using Machine Learning

##Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health metrics. The model is trained on a dataset containing relevant features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels.

##Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Model Selection: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
